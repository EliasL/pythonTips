Here is what you need to do to run the different files
(You can use python -m venv and pip instead, but I will use UV)

[Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)

Run these commands in the project directory:

`uv venv`

`uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you can hopefully run the python code.
